Personal Welcome is a Wordpress MU plugin that allows site administrators to create and send personalised welcome messages to new users.

== Description ==

Personal welcome is a Wordpress MU plugin that lists newly registered users, and allows site administrators to send them a personalised welcome message. The welcome messages are based on templates which you can write yourself (as many templates as you like). Once a message is sent that user won't appear again.

There are four extra management features:

* The ability to set all users as having been sent a welcome message (an easy way to bulk remove everyone from the list, for example when the plugin is first installed)
* The ability to search for a user and send them a welcome message
* The ability to set the new user as being spam
* The ability to set the new user and all their blogs as spam

Of course, the templates don't have to be just for welcoming people - they could contain FAQs, help information or anything else.

The plugin also makes use of the __() function to allow for easy translation.

== Installation ==

The plugin should be placed in your /wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory (*not* /wp-content/plugins/) and requires no activation.

= Why did you write this plugin? =

To scratch my own itch when developing [BeatsBase.com](http://beatsbase.com "Free mix hosting for DJs") and [Wibsite.com](http://wibsite.com "The worlds most popular Wibsite"). Hopefully this plugin helps other developers too.
